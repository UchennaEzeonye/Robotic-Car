# ESP32 Robotic Car Project

## Overview

This repository contains an **ESP32-based robotic car project** that is being continuously developed and improved. The project started as a simple Bluetooth-controlled car and is gradually evolving into a more advanced and autonomous robotic system.

The focus of this project is **learning, experimentation, and progressive improvement** in robotics, embedded systems, and motor control.
